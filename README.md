# 📁 Data Projects (TripleTen)

Welcome to my Data Science bootcamp project portfolio! This repository contains four end-to-end projects I completed as part of TripleTen's 8-month intensive Data Science program.

Each project applies machine learning and data analysis to solve real-world business problems using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and more.
